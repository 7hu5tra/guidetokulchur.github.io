Even if it makes others uncomfortable… 
I will love who I am.” – Janelle Monae

    I am determined.
    To be Eris
    To be black
    To be woman
    To be queer
    To be proud
    To be whole
    To be audacious
    To be fearless
    To be loved 
    To be loving
    To be unbothered
    To be un-swayed
    To be me unconditionally
    & without apology

    … and when necessary 
    To not give a fuck.
