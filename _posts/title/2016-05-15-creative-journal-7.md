## from Tina Groumoutis's
### Freebird

The last time I saw her, vegetarian, gluten-free Christine was eating bacon and saying I could have Evan. She was eating bacon. And smoking. And giving pills from her newspaper days to her float trip husband to take with the frat house beer he was drinking. The last time I saw her, start a business, start a bookstore, start a new job, start a new life, Christine--kissed a girl kindergarten teacher by the bonfire to amuse her new float trip friends. Christine, who bought "this old thing?" at the corner thrift shop, but who gave Heidi Klum an inferiority complex...and Lynard Skynard? No.
