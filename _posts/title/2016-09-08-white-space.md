Eva Barrett is a poet and playwright from Cleveland, OH. She is a 2014 graduate of the Cleveland School of the Arts and is studying History and German at Case Western Reserve University. Her primary artistic focus is studying discourse as power in dialogue and public space, and translating the nuances of human interactions into written and spoken word. She has facilitated classes and workshops in playwriting, poetry, and the historical analysis of poetry, centered around the intersections of postcolonial studies and erotic subjectivity. Eva was the 2016 recipient of the Rocks Experiential Learning Fellowship, with which she travelled to participate in the James Madison University Undergraduate Writing Conference. 

Thatâ€™s all, folks.
