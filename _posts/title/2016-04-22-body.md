Part memoir, part theoretical essay--BODY. finds Washington at his most honest and playful. Centering the narrative around his relationship to his body, and as an extension--the body when in love. The line of subjectivity is blurred, shaded and sometimes erased completely, here is a work that is both formal and deeply personal.
