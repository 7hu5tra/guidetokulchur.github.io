GTK Creative's aim is to publish stories and poems that make us think about who we are, our community, the world, and our place in it. With founder RA Washington's vision in mind, GTK Creative has been home to emerging and marginalized voices since the beginning and is a place for writers and readers to come together in appreciation and celebration of each other.

Each issue is curated and edited by Krystal Sierra and printed quarterly in limited, perfect-bound, hand-crafted editions of 300 by Guide To Kulchur Press in the Historic Detroit Shoreway Neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.
